# Mod Tutorial for The Campaign Trail

This is a repository meant to be a tutorial for modding The Campaign Trail. The tutorial itself is currently under construction, and so I won't be posting it publicly until its completion. If you managed to find this, let me know how it is so far. Thank you.

The tutorial can be found on the Wiki for this Repository.

## What is that?

It's a browser game where you play as a candidate and try to win an election. The game is currently hosted on two sites, [Campaign Trail Showcase](https://campaigntrailshowcase.com/campaign-trail/) and [New Campaign Trail](https://www.newcampaigntrail.com/campaign-trail/).
